# 6_DOF_Inverse_kinematics
inverse kinematics for a 6 DOF manipulator


Inverse kinematics for a 6 DOF manipulator. All the calculations are done on the computer since the arduino can only use floats
which for this calculation are too limited. Inverse kinematics equations can all be found in chapter 2 of "Modelling and Control of Robot Manipulators, Lorenzo Sciavicco and Bruno Siciliano".
